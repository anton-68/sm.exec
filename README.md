# SM.EXEC
# *Make any network programmable*

SM.EXEC is a network service logic execution environment and tool chain. Technically SM.EXEC is a C library for building asynchronous event-based signalling processor and similar eactive systems on top of C/POSIX plstform.

Potential application of this framework are any control plane elements in networks of any type and of any size. See e.g. a project brief description of possible applivation of SM.EXEC for building of home networks of a new generation: [Towards Programmable Home Networks](https://github.com/anton-68/membrane/blob/master/doc/Towards%20Programmable%20Home%20Networks.md).

Other possible application are:
- SDN controller.
- SIP protocols elements (Application Server, Registrar, IMS signalling elements including x-CSCF etc).
- Traditional voice network control plane elements (SCP, gsmSCF, gsmSSF etc.).
- Mobile network control plane including 4G-5G-6G radio and core network elements.
- WiFi network controller.
- Industry 4.0 and IoT control plane solutions.
- ...
