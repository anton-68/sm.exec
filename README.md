# SM.EXEC

SM.EXEC is a network service logic execution environment and tool chain. Technically SM.EXEC is a C library for building asynchronous event-based signalling processor and similar eactive systems on top of C/POSIX plstform.

Please see the SM.EXEC whitepaper, explaining project goals and approach: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379564545_SMEXEC_A_Network_Service_Logic_Execution_Environment_Architecture]

Please also check the Membrane project based on top of AM.EXEC library - the proof-of-concemt project aimed at defining proper software architecture for programmable secure home (and generally - small and not so small) networks: [https://github.com/anton-68/membrane]
